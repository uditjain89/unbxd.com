1. From linux xterm use command 'make' , it will create an executable unbxd

2. Use command './unbxd' to launch the program

*********************************************************

1. The program takes 2 files as input , a products description file , and a records description file. 

2. I have included two sample files , 'products.txt' and 'records.txt'. You can provide your own files, the program asks for name of
   the input files.

3. I have assumed query to be a 1 word string , while reading records file. 
   However the database can handle even multiple word queries.
   Product ID , is taken as an integer, all other attributes are assumed as strings.

4. I have not written Destructors for the Database, I was not able to spare much time.

 
I have coded the solution for the given case problem. 

Warm regards :)
